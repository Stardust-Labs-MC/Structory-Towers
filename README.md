## Notes
- Structory: Towers is compatible with the majority of worldgen and structure datapacks, such as Terralith or Structory
- You can add Structory: Towers to existing worlds, but structures will only generate in new chunks
- This is compatible with Waystones
- View the structures per seed using [jacobsjo](https://github.com/jacobsjo)'s [Minecraft Datapack Map](https://map.jacobsjo.eu/)

## Description
### Seasons
Alongside regular updates, [Structory](https://github.com/Stardust-Labs-MC/Structory) consistently receives themed content expansions. These feature short, ambient stories told through villagers and their structures, building on and adding to the structures already found throughout the world. 

Season 1 brought the Ruins update. Deep inside the swamps, the **Mangrove Ruins** can be found... but if you dare venture into a colder climate, you may stumble upon the **Taiga Ruins**. What stories are these old structures trying to tell? Season 2 brought the Harvest update. Legend says evil witches can be found in the **Old Manor**, brewing something mysterious. but if you wander too far, you could find yourself trapped in a rare **Graveyard**.

### Add-Ons
Separate from its content expansions, [Structory](https://github.com/Stardust-Labs-MC/Structory) will have add-ons which can be used either in conjunction with Structory, or as its own standalone datapack. This allows players and modpack creators to dynamically add or remove parts of Structory to fit their own taste and playstyle. Structory: Towers is the first add-on created for Structory!
